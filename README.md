# chopin toolbox
A toolbox mostly for statistical models and formating.

## Description
The toolbox contains various handy functions for manipulating files and data, more 'serious' functions for automatical stastistical analyses, a few stat tools and other handy functions for automatically plotting the data.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
* Tested on Matlab R2020b
* Tested on Windows 11 pro but should work cross-platforms

### Installing
* download the code
* add its containing folder to your matlab search path

## Content
### check_distrib_indep
To visualize the shape of dependent variable distribution and test whether normal with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

* check for difference between groups using a non-paramatric test
* if not different, group data, otherwise keep separated
* plot dependent variable distributions (line 1: group 1 is on column 1, group 2 on column 2, pooled data on column 3)
* check for normality of the distribution using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
* if non-normal, attempt to transform the data in log10 and plot it (second line)

#### Typical use
```matlab
check_distrib_indep(data.initial_work_mem(data.meditation==1),data.initial_work_mem(data.meditation==2),'initial_work_mem'); % data.initial_work_mem(data.meditation==1) gathers data for the first group
```
Results obtained:
  initial_work_mem - Wilcoxon-Mannâ€“Whitney (signed-ranks) U = 800, p = 0.0017
  Data are significantly different, so let's keep them separated
  Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for normality:  Group 1 - KS = 0.19, p = 0.2653 and Group 2 - KS = 0.09, p = 0.9626

### Automated GLM (generalized) pipeline
The following functions are used together to easily separate model selection from statistics. 
* check_distrib_indep to visualize the shape of dependent variable distribution and test whether normal with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
* all_glm automatically tests and ranks all GLMs as combinations of factors/interactions of factors/link functions
* display_model formats the results in the command window
* plot_group_effect/plot_covariate_effect plots the results easily

#### Typical use
```matlab
% explore which distribution is correct
check_distrib_indep(data.initial_work_mem(data.meditation==1),data.initial_work_mem(data.meditation==2),'initial_work_mem');

% define a model structure
    % a factor or a list of factors that are always included in the model (for the moment, works with only one - use '' for none)
    model.solid_factors = {'name_of_factor_or_list'};
    % a list of possible factors to be included, that can be removed if needed, and the interactions terms to explore
    model.liquid_factors =   {'name_factor1','meditation','name_factor1:name_factor2'};
    % the maximal nb of factors to explore in the model - as a rule of thumb, you need ~10 datapoints for each
    model.max_nb_factors = 5;
    % the name of the dependent variable in the data structure, here it is data.initial_work_mem
    model.dv = 'initial_work_mem';
    % its distribution among poisson, normal, gamma, inverse gaussian, binomial as previously determined
    model.distribution = 'normal';
    % a table with the data, here called data
    model.data = data;
    %  a list of possible link functions among 'log', 'reciprocal','identity','-2','-3','probit','logit','loglog','comploglog'
    model.links = {'log', 'identity'};
    % outliers/subjects to be removed - can be left empty
    model.exclude = [8,12]; 
    % no warnings - careful with that option
    model.warning_off = 1; 

% run the model
mdls = all_glm(model);

% display diagnostics and results
display_model(mdls{1}) %plot best model - you can select any other models according to the results on the various indicators provided
h=subplot(1,4,4);

% add plots of results and save figures
plot_group_effect(data.initial_work_mem, data.meditation, h, 'Meditation group', 'initial working memory performance', {'Meditators','Non-meditators'})
saveas(gcf,fullfile(figure_path,'initial working memory.png'));
snapnow; %plot figure when publishing markup code
```
